### 🚀 About Me: Bridging AI, Research, and Design

I am a results-driven **AI Engineer and Researcher** with a strong foundation in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP**. I believe the most impactful AI solutions are built at the intersection of robust engineering and human-centered design.

Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science while actively solving complex problems through research and full-stack project implementation.

💡 **My Focus Areas:**
- **Advanced NLP/LLMs:** Engineering RAG systems and optimizing Small Language Models (SLMs)
- **MLOps & Full-Stack AI:** Integrating models with scalable backend/frontend (Python, React, AWS)
- **Design-Driven Development:** Applying UX/UI principles to ensure AI interfaces are intuitive and effective
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Demonstrated ability to build and deploy complex systems under pressure (Hackathons)
