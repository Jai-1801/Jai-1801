### 🚀 About Me: Bridging AI, Research, and Design

[cite_start]I am a results-driven **AI Engineer and Researcher** with a strong foundation in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP**[cite: 9]. I believe the most impactful AI solutions are built at the intersection of robust engineering and human-centered design.

[cite_start]Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science [cite: 53, 54] while actively solving complex problems through research and full-stack project implementation.

💡 **My Focus Areas:**
- [cite_start]**Advanced NLP/LLMs:** Engineering RAG systems and optimizing Small Language Models (SLMs)[cite: 39, 50].
- [cite_start]**MLOps & Full-Stack AI:** Integrating models with scalable backend/frontend (Python, React, AWS)[cite: 11, 22, 23, 37].
- [cite_start]**Design-Driven Development:** Applying UX/UI principles to ensure AI interfaces are intuitive and effective[cite: 9, 26].
- [cite_start]**Rapid Prototyping:** Demonstrated ability to build and deploy complex systems under pressure (Hackathons)[cite: 46, 47].
