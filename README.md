### 🎨 Design Philosophy

> **"Good design is not just about aesthetics—it's about creating meaningful experiences that users love and businesses need."**

My design process:
1. **Research & Empathize** - Understanding user needs and pain points
2. **Define & Ideate** - Creating solutions backed by data
3. **Prototype & Test** - Iterating based on feedback
4. **Develop & Deliver** - Bringing designs to life with code
